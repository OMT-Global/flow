# OMT-Global Flow

Org-level autonomous flow protocol for OMT-Global issues, PRs, worker lanes, and merge gates.

For the high-level relationship between `flow`, `bootstrap`, `.github`, individual repos, Pheidon, and worker lanes, see [OMT-Global Operating Map](docs/omt-global-operating-map.md).

Use `project.bootstrap.yaml` as the control plane for repo-local scaffolding, GitHub governance, CI policy, and portable Codex profile sync. Plan first, then apply repo, GitHub, and home targets deliberately.

## What The Bootstrap Owns

- GitHub governance, issue labels, environments, and optional org defaults

- Repo-local `AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and pull request template guidance
- Fast PR checks plus heavier extended validation lanes
- SemVer release automation with floating major/minor compatibility tags

- Portable Codex home profile sync
- Operator docs for onboarding, hosted agents, and follow-up setup

## Quickstart

```sh
bootstrap plan --manifest ./project.bootstrap.yaml
bootstrap apply repo --manifest ./project.bootstrap.yaml
bootstrap apply github --manifest ./project.bootstrap.yaml
bootstrap apply home --manifest ./project.bootstrap.yaml
bootstrap doctor --manifest ./project.bootstrap.yaml
```

Daily fleet reconciliation should start in plan mode and write a report:

```sh
bootstrap reconcile --workspace-root ~/src --report bootstrap-reconcile.json
```

To discover GitHub repos first, add `--org OMT-Global`; repositories without local bootstrapped checkouts are skipped in the report.

Once the repo allowlist is trusted, run repo file drift through draft PRs:

```sh
bootstrap reconcile --workspace-root ~/src --apply-repo --create-pr --report bootstrap-reconcile.json
```

 It also syncs `github.issueLabels` for issue routing, risk, status, and review gates.

Confirm branch protection points at the `CI Gate` status and require approval from someone other than the most recent pusher. When GitHub plan limits make auto-merge unavailable for a private repo, use the fallback merge-readiness policy: required checks pass or are intentionally skipped, approvals and conversation resolution are satisfied, no blocking review state remains, and a maintainer performs the merge manually.

## Contributor And PR Guidance

- `CONTRIBUTING.md` is the canonical contributor onboarding and local validation surface.
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` is the canonical pull request format for summaries, governing issue links, validation notes, and merge-readiness checks.
- Existing bootstrapped repos can retrofit these surfaces with `bootstrap apply repo --manifest ./project.bootstrap.yaml`; repos with restricted `repo.managedPaths` should include both paths before applying.

## Project Identity

- Product name: `OMT-Global Flow`
- Repository: `OMT-Global/flow`
- Manifest: `project.bootstrap.yaml`
- Visibility: `public`
- Default branch: `main`
- Archetype: `generic-empty`


## Release Standard

This bootstrap uses immutable exact SemVer tags such as `v1.2.3`, then automatically advances the floating compatibility tags `v1.2` and `v1` to the same commit.

Cut patch releases from `release/X.Y` branches when you maintain an older minor line. Cut new minor and major releases from `main`.
